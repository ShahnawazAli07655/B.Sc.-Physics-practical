## 📁 List of Experiments

---

## Experiment 1: Coulomb Potential  
**File:** `Coulomb potential.sci`

### Aim  
To study the Coulomb potential using numerical methods.

### Theory  
The Coulomb potential describes the interaction between two charged particles.
It plays a fundamental role in atomic physics, especially in the hydrogen atom.

### Learning Outcome  
Students understand the physical significance of Coulomb interaction in quantum systems.

---

## Experiment 2: Screened Coulomb Potential  
**File:** `screened coulomb.sci`

### Aim  
To study the screened Coulomb (Yukawa-type) potential.

### Theory  
In many-body and plasma systems, the Coulomb interaction is screened due to the
presence of surrounding charges, leading to a screened Coulomb potential.

### Learning Outcome  
Students understand screening effects in realistic physical systems.

## Experiment 3: Morse Potential  
**File:** `Morse potential.sci`

### Aim  
To study the Morse potential using numerical techniques.

### Theory  
The Morse potential is used to model the vibrational structure of diatomic molecules
and provides a more realistic alternative to the harmonic oscillator.

### Learning Outcome  
Students understand molecular vibrations and anharmonic effects.

---

## Experiment 4: Anharmonic Potential  
**File:** `Aharmonic potential.sci`

### Aim  
To study an anharmonic potential numerically.

### Theory  
Anharmonic potentials arise in many physical systems where deviations from ideal
harmonic behavior become significant at higher energies.

### Learning Outcome  
Students understand corrections to the harmonic approximation in quantum mechanics.
