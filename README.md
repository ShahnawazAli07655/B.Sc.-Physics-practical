## 📁 List of Experiments

## Experiment 1: Coulomb Potential  
**File:** `Coulomb potential.sci`

### Aim  
To solve the s-wave Schrödinger equation for the ground state and the first excited
state of the hydrogen atom

\[
\frac{d^2u}{dr^2} = A(r)u(r), \quad
A(r) = \frac{2m}{\hbar^2}[V(r) - E]
\]

where

\[
V(r) = -\frac{e^2}{r}
\]

and obtain the energy eigenvalues and plot the corresponding wave functions.
Remember that the ground state energy of the hydrogen atom is −13.6 eV.
Take  
\( e = 3.795 \, (\text{eV Å}) \),  
\( \hbar c = 1973 \, (\text{eV Å}) \),  
\( m = 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}/c^2 \).

### Theory  
The Coulomb potential describes the interaction between two charged particles.
It plays a fundamental role in atomic physics, especially in the hydrogen atom.

### Learning Outcome  
Students understand the physical significance of Coulomb interaction in quantum systems.

## Experiment 2: Screened Coulomb Potential  
**File:** `screened coulomb.sci`

### Aim  
To study the screened Coulomb (Yukawa-type) potential.

### Theory  
In many-body and plasma systems, the Coulomb interaction is screened due to the
presence of surrounding charges, leading to a screened Coulomb potential.

### Learning Outcome  
Students understand screening effects in realistic physical systems.

## Experiment 3: Morse Potential  
**File:** `Morse potential.sci`

### Aim  
To study the Morse potential using numerical techniques.

### Theory  
The Morse potential is used to model the vibrational structure of diatomic molecules
and provides a more realistic alternative to the harmonic oscillator.

### Learning Outcome  
Students understand molecular vibrations and anharmonic effects.

---

## Experiment 4: Anharmonic Potential  
**File:** `Aharmonic potential.sci`

### Aim  
To study an anharmonic potential numerically.

### Theory  
Anharmonic potentials arise in many physical systems where deviations from ideal
harmonic behavior become significant at higher energies.

### Learning Outcome  
Students understand corrections to the harmonic approximation in quantum mechanics.
